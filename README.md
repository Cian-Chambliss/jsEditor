# jsEditor

Xdialog Desktop integrated html editor built on mediumJs

Instructions:

1. Create a folder called "data" on the c drive.
2. Clone the project in the data folder location:

```bat
git clone https://github.com/Cian-Chambliss/jsEditor.git
```
3. Create a new alpha anywhere workspace (or open a new workspace), and copy the contents of test.a5scr into a new xbasic script in the workspace.

Running the script should bring up the editor.

The "get" and "set" buttons control getting and setting the html content.
